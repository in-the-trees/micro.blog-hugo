This was formerly my custom Hugo theme for Micro.blog.

Feel free to poke around this repo. It's a pretty sophisticated (but hacky) Hugo theme with a lot of features built around my own specific use cases: [breadcrumbs](https://github.com/in-the-trees/micro.blog_/blob/main/layouts/partials/backlink.html), [rich link generation](https://github.com/in-the-trees/micro.blog_/blob/main/assets/ts/og.ts), [my own implementation](https://github.com/in-the-trees/micro.blog_/blob/main/assets/ts/conversation/conversation.ts) of [Conversation.js](https://help.micro.blog/t/replies-with-conversation-js/67), [relative time generation](https://github.com/in-the-trees/micro.blog_/blob/main/assets/ts/relative-time.ts), ["ephemeral" posts](https://github.com/in-the-trees/micro.blog_/blob/main/assets/ts/page/microblog-post-list.ts) & thus an [archive page](https://github.com/in-the-trees/micro.blog_/blob/main/layouts/partials/microblog-post-list.html), and a few other things.

I liked this theme; a lot of time was put into it and it worked well. However, I was stretching beyond what Hugo was designed for. Once I started requiring JavaScript to display content, it was probably best to pivot to a JavaScript framework.

For my [new website](https://inthetrees.me), I essentially built an improved [replica](https://github.com/in-the-trees/next-jade) of this theme with Next.js. This increased flexibility, control, and performance while reducing strict reliance on client-side JS. Still, I'm proud of this theme and I think it's a decent showcase for what can be done with Hugo + Micro.blog.
